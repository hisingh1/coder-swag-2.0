Adjustment to Table view and Collection View

This is a second approch keeping in mind the changes to the new xcode 12. Which fixes minor issues to my previous application.
This is project we build a virtual store. All the assests belong to a teaching course. We focus on the table view and collectien views by making a store that uses these views.
